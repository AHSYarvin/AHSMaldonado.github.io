<p>1.What makes video games entertaining is that it allows you to stay connected and communicate with your friends even from far away. For example I might not live close to a friend because I moved or I am out of town but through video games we are still able to communicate and have fun together.

Almost all games have a reward system. This gives players a purpose to play the game. These consistent rewards and achievements systems give the player much more accomplishments than they would in their daily lives. This feature makes people more motivated to succeed, giving the player happiness and fun. Different games fuffil different categories which allows everybody to have something they like and does not exclude anyone. This allows a bigger community. Since you chose whatever you want to do this allows different play styles and everybody can have their own personality through the game.

<p>2.I agree with this article because it talks about the best features of the game and it is not biased. The author talks about how the gameplay is fun and balanced. He also compares it to the past 2k’s and how 2k23 is better due to its new features like the new neighborhood, the new MyTeam cards, and the new changeable shooting meter.

<p>3.The computer of my dreams would be a desktop PC because even though it is stationary and not portable like a laptop it is more capable and will benefit me in gaming. I would get a pre-built PC that focuses on video editing. This is because this type of computer is good for gaming and will also help me if I want to make videos or stream my gaming in the future. My purpose with this computer would be to game and stream so I would focus on the video graphics card and the GPU of the computer.

<p>5.Toxicity In Video Games
Toxicity in gaming has always been around and it will continue if we dont do something about it. Toxicity in video games could be considered a way of cyberbullying and affects others lifes and mental health.What gamers say during their gaming sessions could affect another person's life in ways they never intended to. For example self hatred, stress, and even making them want to hurt themselves. Gaming is a way for people to enjoy themselves and have fun; instead it has become a dangerous environment where hurtful things are said all the time. Gamers need to put a stop to this toxicity and just enjoy playing their games and their time with their friends in a safe online environment.

<p>6.NRG is an esports team and organization that has played in the Rocket League Champion Series 3 times. Their star players are jstn., Garrett G, and BenjyFishy. What makes them a great team is their communication, determination, and ability to not give up underpressure. This is proven by their victory in the 2019 RLCS which they won due to the clutch goal from jstn. In order to send it to overtime and win the tournament.They also have good sponsors and investors like The Generals,Shaquille O’Neil, and Alex Rodriguez.They still aren’t a perfect team. They need work in their substitutes and training. They also should focus more on their competitive side rather than their content creating.
